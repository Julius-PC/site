            <h2>History of 88Rising</h2>
            <p>Founder and long-time CEO Sean Miyashiro had a clear vision for what he
wanted the company to achieve as an Asian American brand. Before establishing
88Rising, Miyashiro was already involved in music. While working at Vice, a
Canadian American lifestyle magazine, he started THUMP, the company’s electronic
music platform that acted as a forum for news in music. “[Working] at THUMP
taught Miyashiro invaluable lessons about brand-building in an ever-accelerating
Internet culture”, translating over into the provision of his own independent
company.1 The founder has often made remarks of people “likening [88Rising] to an
Asian Vice in terms of content quality.”Unlike Vice, however, 88Rising was a
medium "dedicated to celebrating global Asian culture". The only problem now was
finding a way to reconcile the Asian American experience. As Miyashiro puts it, “We
are clearly filling a void, which is a pan-Asian, East-meets-West approach.”</p>
            <p>Born in San Jose, California to an Asian household, Sean Miyashiro’s plan to
incorporate his two worlds originated from the multicultural melting pot of the Bay
Area. Here, Miyashiro was introduced to a diverse range of musical genres growing
up, taking an interest in the rising influence of hip-hop, particularly in the works of
Wu-Tang Clan. The group’s name itself “[spoke] to [him], the way it infused
appreciation and true knowledge” of Eastern culture into their music, Miyashiro
claimed in an interview with Wu Tang’s own RZA. These sentiments carried on to
how 88Rising would identify talent and focus their marketing, denoting an exchange
of culture between Black and Asian.</p>

            <h2>The Star Roster</h2>
            <p>88Rising’s very first management signees were Korean and Indonesian
rappers, Keith Ape and Rich Brian, followed by a Chinese rap group known as the
Higher Brothers, and the aforementioned R&B act, Joji.1 The subsequent success of
these artists in the U.S. helped to break into the wider Western demographic that
appealed to these genres while subverting Asian stereotypes that had long
protruded across music: Wiz Khalifa’s song “Hot Now” with lyrics “smoke got my
eyes lookin’ Korean”, Doja Cat’s debut single “So High” with the line “now we both
look Asian”, once again in reference to smoking, or the general fetishization of
“yellow b*tches” and “Asian broads” across the rap genre.4 Instead, 88Rising
revolved around paving the way for Asian artists to make meaningful music around
their identity in the style of American music, sustaining a symbiotic relationship of
East and West. “We want to push the culture forward,” Miyashiro tells CNN. “We’re
not trying to break stereotypes or change people’s mindsets. We’re showing people
what we can do, by doing what we do.”</p>
