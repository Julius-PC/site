            <h2>Kpop in Context</h2>
            <p>The assimilation of K-pop groups into American culture was only possible
through bringing an existing formula from Korean pop culture to a fresh audience in
the West. Looking back to the origins of K-pop, author and Korean pop culture expert Hark Joon Lee designated one group, Seo Taiji and Boys, as the fathers of K-
pop. Funnily enough, they were explicitly an Asian hip-hop group. Though not well-
received at first, their music ended up dominating the charts across a newer generation of youth that appealed to its “dramatic departure from mainstream
[Korean] popular music” of the time, typically consisting of slow ballads and trot.
This juxtaposition confronted the conventional norms of the conservative, typically
observed in East Asian cultures, catalyzed by the transfer of a fresh and distinctive sound originating from the U.S. Since then, the K-pop genre had distanced itself from its hip-hop roots, “developing [into the] unique local pop music” that was more
EDM-centric and visual performance-based in the mid-2010s. When it did
eventually reach the U.S., it was received well for its unique undertones as their own
interpretation of the craft of popular music.</p>
            <p>The need to accommodate the mainstream appeal of K-pop music meant
straying away from the distinct American hip-hop/R&B sound that 88Rising once
mastered. 88Rising’s artist roster began to look a little different from 2019 onwards.
The label most notably signed new artists including Jackson Wang and CHUNGHA,
both prevalent former K-pop artists from established K-groups such as GOT7 and
I.O.I., respectively. Their debut projects under 88Rising, MIRRORS and Querencia,
respectively, failed to achieve the same success as the label’s original star roster, and
Head In The Clouds 2, the successive project, fell short of its expectations. In the East,
the Korean reception was equally disappointing with no significant buzz,
symbolizing a mismatch of what the new Korean generation was looking for.
88Rising’s ventures were simply a candid repurposing of their own K-pop structure
with an Asian-American label slapped onto it, meaning the public was unsurprised.</p>

            <h2>The Downfall...</h2>
            <p>The diminishing prevalence of 88Rising in pop culture, on the one hand, can be attributed to the decrease in releases and media prominence from their star
roster (Joji, Rich Brian). Yet through a combination of mismanagement and strict
creative bureaucracy, most suggestively due to the change in priorities in adapting
to the mainstream Asian K-pop culture, these artists were neglected in their creative
endeavors. Their transition into the K-pop market may have in fact stimulated greater public interest in the United States, reaping the benefits of attracting a new,
K-pop-based audience. However, by doing so, they neglected their existing audience
which made up a majority of their following. The whole purpose of collaborating
with K-artists was to tend to the emergence of Asian culture, but these were far in
comparison to the Asian-American acts they used to feature that captivated their
previous demographic.</p>
            <p>In recent years, 88Rising’s artist roster has continued to vary, putting a focus
on girl groups. XG and Atarashii Gakko are examples of Japanese girl groups whose
brands uphold a resounding resemblance to that of the modern K-pop structure,
prompting the record label to sign a publishing deal with the former, and managing
the latter. These sentiments, however, varied a lot from their existing artist line-up
that upheld more hip-hop and R&B styles. This begs the question of what the
emergent Asian media landscape desires today. Now, with the global success of acts
like Laufey, Grent Perez, and beabadoobee, we are observing a spike in bossa nova,
jazz, and indie rock, influences through Asian brands, which just as well might be
the next step forward in the music industry.</p>
