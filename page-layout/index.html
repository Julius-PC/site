            <h2>Introduction</h2>
            <p>In January 2013, the Internet started off strong with the emergence of the
    “Harlem Shake” trend, its origins tracing back to a YouTube comedy sketch artist
    who boasted the moniker Filthy Frank. A deep dive into Filthy Frank’s other content
    revealed the true nature of this raunchy internet lowlife, with videos titled “RAT
    CHEF” or “RACIST WORDS IN JAPANESE (JAPANESE 101)” to name a few, the man
    behind the moniker being a Japanese American known as George Miller. George
    Miller would go on to receive a 5x Platinum RIAA certification 9 years later on his
    2018 single “SLOW DANCING IN THE DARK” under his R&B persona, Joji. 88Rising,
    the representative mass media company for Joji and many more, is the mastermind
    behind such mainstream success in the late 2010s. Their distinctive approach in
    integrating their roster to a hip-hop and R&B audience in America allowed Asian-
    American talent to shine through the music industry, seemingly making the
    unmarketable marketable. This begs the question, how did a label that so
    meticulously formed the bridge between East and West, establishing a token brand
    that would seemingly take over the music industry, lose it all...?</p>

            <h2>Key Idea</h2>
            <p>Within a 5-year lifespan, 88Rising had gone from once taking on the Big
    Three in the Top charts, to completely dropping under the radar. Despite efforts to
    sustain their popularity, their downfall could very well be their own fault. 88Rising's
    shift in content towards a primarily Asian audience, capitalizing on the
    popularization of K-pop in international mass culture, significantly decreased
    traction among their previously broader demographic that celebrated their unique
    style, diminishing the company's overall commercial significance and media
    prominence.</p>
